Changelog Rev A4A -> Rev B1
========================

Done:
 + 3-pin end stop input connectors 
	- The chosen pin config (sig, 5v, gnd) is compatible with servos. 
	- Except Z2 which also has 12V available: (sig, 5V, gnd, 12V)
 + Added CD4050BD allows for 15 V inputs on all end stop inputs
 + 2-pin thermistor input
 + Servo output on endstop x2 / y2
	Using 2x M74VHC1GT126
 + Hardcode EEPROM address to 0x54
	- Price reduction and board space. 
 + Major League headers: 
	- Price reduction
 + DAC exchanged with PWM + RC for IREF. 
	- 1. order low pass filter, R=10K, C=4.7uF gives 13.0mV ripple at 1 KHz. 
	Maximum attainable precision is 2.5/4096 = 0.61 mV 
   	- Online tool: http://sim.okawa-denshi.jp/en/PWMtool.php
	- TODO: Increase PWM or use sharper filter. 
 + Blue LED to indicate fuse blown 
	- Price reduction (BOM lines)
 + Larger bulk capacitance. 
	- New electrolytic Capacitors (one for each stepper driver)
 + Reverse polarity protection. 
	- MBRA shotky diode. 
 + Remove gate driver on main mosfet. 
	The gate capacitiance of the AON6758 is 92pf. 
	With 100 ohm series resitors on the power mosfet gate, the 
	rise time is 60ns giving a slew rate of 500 V/uS. This equates to 
	46 mA maxiumum current drawn. The PCA986 has a maximum current source capacity of 
	10 mA, giving a maxiumum slew rate of 109 V/uS which gives a power dissipation 
	of 3? W at 180W load with a PWM frequency of 1 KHz. 
 + Remove 4.7K res on address of PCA986. 
	- Price and board space reduction
	- This is given as example in PCA986 datasheet. 
 + New stepper drivers: TMC2100
	- Lower audible noise level on steppers. 
 + PWM for servos from BBB. 
 + Four pin connector on end stop Z2 adds 12V for magnetic resonance sensor. 
 + New Capacitors: Better capacitance at higher voltage. 
 + New low power mos fets: End of life, lower price smaller footprint. 
 + Less BOM lines 
 + 500 ohm series resistors = 10 mA on all mosfets. 
 + Use free pin on shift registers to enable servo outputs
 + Make sure heaters are turned off in case of kernel panic. 
	- Using BBB watchdog in conjunction with enable pin on P9.41. 
 + Removed External connector since PWM ciurcuit needs to be available on 
	 Reach anyway. Use SPI_CS0 for the shift registers. 

NOTES: 
Stepper drivers: 
 - TMC2100: $2.5
	+ Cheaper
   	+ More configuration options for lower noise. 
   	- Tristate configurations. 

- Reverse Polarity protection on input:
	- Currently using MBRA340T3 in a crowbar connection. 
	Alternative: AON6407, PFET. 
	- More expensive
	- More effect loss (5mOhm x Vin x Iin)
	+ Does not blow the fuse. 

ADC precicion calculations: 
 - 12 bit ADC, 1.8V range: 1.8/4096 = 439uV pr bit. 
 - Oversampling

Concerns: 
 - 3.3V logic input although tri state buffers are using 5V VCC for servos. 
 - ADC filtering: Should I use GND_ANA or GND_D? 
 - Low power mosfets, flyback diode? Snubber? 
	- No, not inductiuve load. (well, it might be but not a large inductive) 
 - Capacitance for fans? 
	- No, not an inductive load/small load 
 - Schotky diode for reverse polarisation. Must test that is can withstand the power until fuse blows. 
 - Mosfet cooling on drain side 

TMC2100 notes: 
 - Layout is based on the exmaple in section 
	16.4 of the datasheet. 
 - External 5V is available, but since it is from a 
	buck regulator, the ripple is probably below 
	the acceptable levels of 5 mV. 
- AIN Iref using PWM: 
	- 2.5V @ 12 bit = 0.61 mV 
	- Datasheet recommends: 22K + 1uF low pass @ 20KHz = 1.4mV ripple 
	20 KHz gives higher 
	- 10K + 4.7uF low pass @ 1K  = 133mV ripple
	- 22K + 4.7uF low pass @ 1K  = 6.0mV ripple
	- 47K + 10 uF low pass @ 1K  = 1.3mV ripple
	- 10K + 4.7uF low pass @ 10K = 1.3mV ripple, using this. 
- DIAG1 - Index output is left unconnected, since it does not offer any 
	value in this application.
- CFG 3 is left open: 
	-External reference voltage on pin AIN. Current scale set by sense resistors and
	scaled by AIN. 

- CFG0 = Chopper off time: High or low. 
- CFG2 = Microstepping: High, low or Open
- CFG1 = Microstepping: High or low. 
- CFG3 = Use Ext. ref.: Open
- CFG4 = Chopper hysteresis: High or Low 
- CFG5 = Chopper blank time: High or low
- CFG6 = Enable: Connected to common enable. 

PWM notes: 
	- Rdson @ 5V = 0.005 ohm
	- Heating element 180 W @ 12 V:  15 A,  R = U/I = 12/15 = 0.8 ohm
	- Effect loss in Mosfet @ fully on: 1.125 W
	- Max effect loss in package: 4.1W
	- Rise time is I/C = 10mA/92pF = 109V/us => rise time is 12/109 = 0.11 uS
	- Time spent switching @ 10KHz: (1.1*10^-7)/(10^-4) ms = 0.11%
	- Assuming linear switching (wrong assumption, but WTH)
	- TODO: calculate Effect loss @ 10KHz
	
 - CE-markings. Not necessary since it is not a consumer product.
