TODO: 
 + Add 41 pin connector, place it near the Ethernet cable. 
 - Do not use keyed horizontal headers.
 - Keep the connectors that we have, change end stop wiring, so they are not tied to common ground. 
 - 4 x 12V fans!
 - RTD drop in replacement, Add jumper to Select voltage divider for RTD1000
 - Do not Change stepper and end stop connectors to keyed versions. 
 - Double check the final price.
 - Add a second thermistor for measuring chamber tmeperature, use T1 for that.
 - Check price on EuroCircuits for 2 and 15 boards. 

Notes: 
 - Choosing horizontal 41 pin connector to keep profile low. 
 - Needs to either move the BBB, longer 41 pin cable or add a mounting plate. 
 - Pin 9/10 Not connected to anything. 
 - Pin 1 and 2 not connected to anything. 
 - Choosing 0.3 mm traces for Stepper X and E, due to 24V input.
